{#    
     To run this macro as an operation as a dry run, just use the following command:
        dbt run-operation create_stage --args '{database_name: my_database, schema_name: my_schema, stage_name: my_file_format, storage_integration: my_storage_integration, stage_url: my_url}'

     To fully execute this macro and run the commands in snowflake, use the following command instead:
        dbt run-operation create_stage --args '{database_name: my_database, schema_name: my_schema, stage_name: my_stage, storage_integration: my_storage_integration, stage_url: my_url, dry_run: False}'

    Args:
        - dry_run -- Default to True - dry run will output the SQL to the logs but won't execute any of it.

        - schema_name -- Name of the Schema in Snowflake where the file format will be created.
